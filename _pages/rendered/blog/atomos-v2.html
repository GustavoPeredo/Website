<h1 id="atomos-and-the-future">AtomOS and the future</h1>
<p>This will probably be my final post on the series about AtomOS. This
project took too much time out of me, but was also a grateful learning
experience.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Check the <a href="/blog/atomos">previous post</a> for the my
original plan for AtomOS and the <a
href="/blog/re-fitting-everything-together">reasons behind it</a>.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-the-original-plan">Problems with the original
plan</h2>
<p>There is a huge problem in my approach towards AtomOS, it deviates
and ignores many issues raise by Mr. Poettering. I’ll try to explain why
I think this is the case.</p>
<h3 id="the-lack-of-secure-boot">The lack of secure boot</h3>
<p>This is the most aggravating issue with my approach. The whole point
of having a trustchain is to ensure that the system is not tampered,
therefore by simply using as a base an OS without secure boot support,
the whole design was broken from the start.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-sign-the-yourself">Why not sign the yourself?</h4>
<p>This is a valid question, but it’s not as simple as it seems. The
problem is that the kernel is not the only thing that needs to be
signed, but also the bootloader, the initramfs, and the rootfs. The
process of signing all of these is not trivial and would be a
requirement for every individual user.</p>
<h3 id="alpine-as-a-base">Alpine as a base</h3>
<p>Alpine is a very useful distribution, but it is not a good base for
AtomOS. The main reason is of secure boot as already mentioned, but a
second reason is that it is not a very user friendly distribution.
Currently there are many workaround required to make modern Linux
technologies to work (such as pipewire, wayland, etc).</p>
<h3 id="root-tamperability">Root tamperability</h3>
<p>Since the root was not signed, it is possible to tamper with it. This
is a very big problem, and it is not something that can be solve with
verity-dm, but that was lacking on the original design.</p>
<p>(What’s the point of a secure bootloader if the root was
tampered?)</p>
<h2 id="an-alternative-approach">An alternative approach</h2>
<p>The new approach for AtomOS was then to keep the pros from
before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates should be reversable (as well as factory reset).</li>
<li>The distribution should be remixable, allowing users and companies
to remix it as they so wish.</li>
<li>All software in it should just work.</li>
<li>Shouldn’t get in the way of the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as fixint the above: * Lack of secure boot * Alpine as a base
* Root tamperability</p>
<h3 id="the-utopia">The Utopia</h3>
<p>The design of an utopic AtomOS is as follow: * Nix and a EFI
bootloader are the only software that are signed. * The root system is
encrypted with the administrator’s password and a TPM key. * The root
system runs on tmpfs (RAM). * All configurations are managed by nix. *
User files are all encrypted using systemd-homed. * A single CD is both
the installation media and the distribution.</p>
<p>The installation process of such distribution is as follow: 1. The CD
is an encrypted distribution with a generic password that is
automatically decrypted.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>A configuration file says that by default, if booting from a USB,
the system should boot into an installation environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The system dd’s the USB drive to the user’s disk.</p></li>
<li><p>If booting from EFI, the system enrolls the TPM key as the
system’s root key. If not, it keeps the generic password.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon reboot, use systemd-repart to resize the root and home
partitions to fill the disk.</p></li>
<li><p>The user is prompted for account creation and password, removing
the generic password and enrolling the user’s password as the root key
(if administrator).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The boot process of such distribution is as follow: 1. The system
boots into the signed EFI bootloader or to a bootloader on old
architectures.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The bootloader decrypts the root system with the TPM key or the
user’s password.</p></li>
<li><p>The initramfs runs nix store verify to verify the integrity of
the root system.</p></li>
<li><p>The initramfs mounts the root system on tmpfs.</p></li>
<li><p>The initramfs starts systemd.</p></li>
<li><p>Creates zram devices, so memory is not a problem.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming the user has a TPM, the system is now secure. The root
system is encrypted with a key that is only known to the user and the
TPM. The root system is also verified by nix store verify, which ensures
that the root system was not tampered while decrypted.</p>
<p>Factory reset can be achieved by simply running
<code>nixos-rebuild switch --rollback 1</code> or by modifying
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix and running
<code>nixos-rebuild switch</code> and removing the other keys from the
disk encryption.</p>
<p>The system uses grub as a bootloader to achive <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disk_encryption">FDE</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-reality">The reality</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/42127">NixOS doesn’t
support secure boot</a>, though there are <a
href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/156270">proposed
solutions</a>.</p>
<p>NixOS is also missing proper systemd-homed and systemd-parted.</p>
<p>Booting to RAM is not as important as the rest of the features so
that could be dropped for a first version.</p>
<p>Although nix is cool, it is not a requirement for the system to work,
so it could be dropped for a first version. Furthermore it <a
href="https://gist.github.com/matthewpi/08c3d652e7879e4c4c30bead7021ff73">requires
extra work in Fedora Silverblue</a>.</p>
<p>So instead of using NixOS, Fedora Silverblue would be used as a base,
it doesn’t provide much customization, but it allows rollbacks and
factory resets.</p>
<h4 id="the-limitations">The limitations</h4>
<p>It was possible to use systemd-parted to partition the disk
automatically.</p>
<p>Systemd-homed seems to work, but it couldn’t be used with GDM or
SDDM.</p>
<p>For some reason Anaconda (Fedora’s Installer) didn’t allow an
encrypted /boot partition, although it should be possible to do it.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>
<p>Finally, AtomOS will just be a dream. I’m putting this project to
rest after how hard it was to make the nescessary changes to make it
work. There are some final questions I’d like to raise after this:</p>
<p>Instead of having a signed dm-verity verified root, isn’t it possible
to simply encrypt the disk with a password and use a TPM key to decrypt
it?</p>
<p>Why isn’t running the root or /usr/ in a tmpfs more common?</p>
<p>Are there more people working on creating good, secure and reliable
Linux distributions?</p>
