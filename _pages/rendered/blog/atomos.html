<h1 id="atomos-postmodern-os">AtomOS: Postmodern OS</h1>
<p>How would a Linux Postmoder OS look like, according to me (lol).</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>First and foremost, the design decisions of AtomOS are mostly made by
my opinion, this however doesn’t mean they are ungrounded or that can’t
be criticized. On the contrary, hearing adverse or favorable opinions
are great way to improve an idea.</p>
<p>In second place, although I was already working on this distribution
before I read <a
href="https://0pointer.net/blog/fitting-everything-together.html">Fitting
Everything Together</a>, they have similar design decisions, you can
read my opinion about it <a
href="/blog/re-fitting-everything-together">here, as well</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, whether I’ll actually finish building this distro or not, is
a matter of time and will. Although I think it would be very cool.
(UPDATE: I did not finish it, check out <a href="/blog/atomos-v2">AtomOS
v2</a> instead)</p>
<h2 id="main-principles">Main Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updates should be reversable (as well as factory reset).</li>
<li>The distribution should be remixable, allowing users and companies
to remix it as they so wish.</li>
<li>All software in it should just work.</li>
<li>Shouldn’t get in the way of the user.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="partition-scheme">Partition scheme</h2>
<p>The partition scheme of such distribution should be as follow: <img
src="/images/Partitions-AtomOS.svg"
alt="Parition Scheme for AtomOS" /></p>
<p>An encrypted system (recommended) is as follow: <img
src="/images/PartitionsE-AtomOS.svg"
alt="Parition Scheme for Encrypted AtomOS" /></p>
<p>In text:</p>
<ul>
<li>/boot partition.</li>
<li>/ System partition A (read only).</li>
<li>/ System partition B (read only).</li>
<li>/home for user files and applications.</li>
<li>/var for logs and system files that are modified.</li>
<li>/nix for development and cli tools. is recommended for that).</li>
<li>An optional recovery partition (in case something goes wrong).</li>
<li>A snapshot partition to backup home directory (BTRFS).</li>
<li>An EFI partition to boot using UEFI.</li>
</ul>
<p>All partitions should receive <a
href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/volume-label">Labels</a>
so that <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fstab">fstab</a>
doesn’t need to be configured.</p>
<p>More about why these in the “System Boot” and “Updating/Modifying the
system” sections.</p>
<h3 id="partition-formatting">Partition formatting</h3>
<p>Bootloader-wise, <a
href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Ext4">ext4</a> and <a
href="https://wiki.osdev.org/EFI_System_Partition">fat-32</a> are
standard choices. Personally, I think it makes sense for non-encrypted
system partitions to use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS">SquashFS</a>, since it is
(AFAIK) the most well known read-only filesystem; finally all other
partitions are under <a
href="https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Subvolumes.html">BTRFS
subvolumes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installation-process">Installation process</h2>
<p>The installation process of such distribution, would be as
follow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>LiveCD boots to RAM.</li>
<li>Partitions are created, LUKS is opened.</li>
<li>An ISO containing the system image is downloaded (different than
LiveCD).</li>
<li><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/dd">dd</a> is used to burn
System ISO to System partitions A and B and to burn LiveCD ISO to
Recovery.</li>
<li>User is created and <a
href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager">home-manager</a> is
installed for that user.</li>
<li>Boot files are generated, with three boot options (Root A, Root B
and Recovery).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="updatingmodifying-the-system">Updating/Modifying the System</h2>
<p>Updating the system would be simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An ISO with a new version of the system is downloaded</li>
<li>The ISO is cloned to Root A</li>
</ol>
<p>Modifying the system follows a similar process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Generate a modified ISO of the system</li>
<li>Clone the ISO to Root A</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img src="/images/AB-Update.svg"
alt="Visualization of update procedure" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Visualization of update
procedure</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the update or installation is broken, then simply booting to Root
B will allow the user to have a working system.</p>
<p>This method of updating through images in two different partitions is
known as <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/ab/">A/B
systme updates</a>, it is used on <a
href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/ab/">Android</a>, <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uceblk/trivia_deck_has_ab_partition_scheme_similarly_to/">Steam
Deck</a> and suggested by <a
href="https://0pointer.net/blog/fitting-everything-together.html">Lennart
Poettering</a>.</p>
<p>The main advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates don’t affect current running system.</li>
<li>If something goes wrong, the user can simply rollback.</li>
<li><a
href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/dm-verity">dm-verity</a>
can be used to verify if the files are the expected ones.</li>
<li>Update is consistent and equal across all installs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="generating-new-isos">Generating New ISOs</h3>
<p>Ideally new updates would be generated by a script that would:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download <a
href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Stage_tarball#Stage_3">Stage 3
tarballs</a> and unpack them to a folder.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chroot">Chroot</a> into
the folder.</li>
<li>Run a script that installs additional packages, enable <a
href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_services.htm">services</a>,
create directories and configures /etc.</li>
<li>Leave chroot.</li>
<li>Package everything into an ISO.</li>
</ol>
<p>An even better solution would be to run these as a <a
href="https://github.com/iximiuz/docker-to-linux">Docker</a> or <a
href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> containers, so steps that didn’t
change can be cachaed.</p>
<p>Finally, some distros have tutorials/tools on how to do these ( <a
href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archiso">Arch</a>, <a
href="https://www.arcolinuxiso.com/">Arco</a>, <a
href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/How_to_make_a_custom_ISO_image">Alpine</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-image">Ubuntu</a>) and
most people would be able to create their own remixes and share
them!</p>
<h2 id="system-boot">System Boot</h2>
<p>The operating system would have it’s boot on a separate partition,
this partition will be used to unlock LUKS if encrypted and mount the
appropriate root partition (A or B) (as <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bootup.7.html">sysroot</a>)
to an <a
href="https://www.jamescoyle.net/knowledge/1659-what-is-tmpfs">overlay
tmpfs</a>.</p>
<p>An overlay tmpfs simply means the system is booted to RAM, this
allows for extremely fast software startup times and for safe
configuration/software tests (since all changes to the root partition
are forgotten after a reboot).</p>
<h2 id="software-management">Software Management</h2>
<p>Such OS would have three ways of managing software:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>System Software (bundled in the ISO)</li>
<li>User/Dev Software (managed by nix)</li>
<li>Applications (installed by flatpak)</li>
</ol>
<p>Software bundled by the ISO should be “essential” programs, in a
desktop OS I’d consider them: System utilities (file manager, settings,
partition manager, printing support, etc), user utilities (internet
browser, text editor, image viewer) and a desktop environment.</p>
<p>Other software that users might want to install or configured, can be
installed through nix or flatpak. I give reasons as for why and which
one is better in certain cases in <a href="/blog/nix-flatpak">this blog
post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="atomos-in-practice">AtomOS in practice</h2>
<p>The closest I currently can get from having AtomOS actually working
is by having a variation of <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine
Linux</a>. As mentioned before, Alpine Linux has <a
href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/How_to_make_a_custom_ISO_image_with_mkimage">good
instructions on making your own ISO</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/jirutka">Jakob Jirutka</a> wrote an <a
href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/alpine-make-vm-image">amazing
tool</a> to make it even easier; Alpine Linux also has a handy <a
href="https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/mkinitfs/-/blob/master/initramfs-init.in">overlaytmpfs
boot option</a> to allow the System to boot to RAM. To finish off,
Alpine Linux devs made the System so compact that a full Desktop
(flatpak, nix, plasma, kde-applicaitons, networkmanager, pipewire, cups,
firefox, zram and video hardware acceleartion) weights around 1.2GB
(WHAT?)!</p>
<p>The system is able to boot to RAM and to mount the home partition
correctly in a VM, I couldn’t make it work on real hardware. Neither
plasma-wayland nor xorg seems to want to initializem, which is a
shame.</p>
<p>Besides that, only a graphical interface to manage updates would be
required. Everything else already exists!</p>
<h3 id="the-pros-of-atomos">The pros of AtomOS</h3>
<ul>
<li>System is distributed for most users identically, therefore
bugs/solutions are more general and less case specific.</li>
<li>Promotes community contribution and remixes through easy ISO
generation and nix.</li>
<li>The entire system runs on RAM, meaning it is more responsive.</li>
<li>Works on both old and newer hardware.</li>
<li>Seamless and safe updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-cons-of-atomos">The cons of AtomOS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lacks some more advanced Systemd functionalities.</li>
<li>Alpine development is not much focused on Desktop Linux.</li>
</ul>
